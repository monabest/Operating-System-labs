Source code files are in the src file.
To run the program from the command line.
Need to change the absolute file path in Scheduler.java. ( I use my own file path)
Compile all the java file

javac *.java

Then from command line, enter 

java Driver

Then you can enter the input file's absolute path.for example

/Users/MonaBest/Desktop/oslab2/input/input-6.txt
--verbose /Users/MonaBest/Desktop/oslab2/input/input-6.txt


Then you can get the output for 4 algorithm runs the same input.
By the way, my program accepts the input with (), for  3 (0 1 20 1) (0 1 20 1) (10 1 10 1)
